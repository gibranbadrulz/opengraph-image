# Opengraph Image

![opengraph-image](https://socialify.git.ci/gibranbadrulz/opengraph-image/image?description=1&font=Inter&language=1&owner=1&pattern=Plus&theme=Dark)

This is a service that generates dynamic Open Graph images that you can embed in your <meta> tags.

Later you can use playwright or puppeteer headless chromium to render an HTML page and take a screenshot of the result which gets cached.

## Usage

```shell
> npm install
> npm run dev
```
